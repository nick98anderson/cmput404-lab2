1. when you initialize the socket with the following line of code:
   s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
   the default protocol used is TCP. 

2. Server sockets bind to ports and listen for incoming connections while Client sockets connect and listening to serverings and 
   initiate the comunication. 

3. s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1) -- This line lets us reuse the same port 

4. Server recieves TCP sockets  with a payload. this payload could be some form of request the client is asking the server.

5. tells us that thrhe request that was sent to the server and if a 200 status code indicating it was succesful.
